We can put any type of file into Git. It is especially good at keeping track of text files such as Python, Javascript, HTML and CSS. A very common file is the README, which is used to tell people what the repository is about. Create a new file called README inside myfirstrepo/ with your text editor. (You can make it in Sublime and save in the directory, then open it via terminal.)

git add <file> = will add file with "file" name
git add . = will adda all file sin directory
